Shamba Intelligence is an AI-powered agricultural platform that transforms satellite imagery and environmental data into actionable insights for farmers, government agencies, and agro-dealers across Rwanda. By combining data from Google Earth Engine, Sentinel, MODIS, and ERA5 climate reanalysis with an open-source Llama language model, our solution delivers personalized recommendations for soil management, crop selection, and resource optimization.
The platform addresses critical challenges in Rwanda's agricultural sector by detecting early signs of soil degradation, optimizing water usage, and increasing crop yields through precision farming techniques. Users receive real-time data on soil health, humidity, rainfall, and pH levels through a mobile application with an integrated chatbot that interprets complex data into simple, actionable guidance in local languages.
Designed with digital public good principles at its core, Shamba Intelligence directly supports Sustainable Development Goals 2 (Zero Hunger), 13 (Climate Action), and 15 (Life on Land) by empowering smallholder farmers with technology previously available only to large agricultural operations. Our phased implementation strategy will expand from the Eastern Province across Rwanda, ultimately reaching over 120,000 farmers and protecting vital arable land while increasing food security and climate resilience.
Through democratizing access to agricultural intelligence, Shamba Intelligence enables data-driven farming decisions that benefit individual farmers while contributing to Rwanda's national agricultural transformation and environmental sustainability goals.
